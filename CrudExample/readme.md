# CRUD Generated Examples

This dir contains example code generated by the functional tests for apiato container and Angular module. The `codeceptSetup` dir is just for testing purposes, to avoid manual execution of cedeception scripts on testing.

This examples should be always up to date since they are copied every time the functional tests are executed. Check the generated code for reference.
